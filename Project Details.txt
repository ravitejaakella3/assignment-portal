Assignment Overview


This project is a web-based system designed to manage users, admins and assignments. It allows users to register, log in and upload assignments. Admins have the ability to view, accept or reject these assignments. The system ensures security through JWT-based authentication. The backend is developed using Node.js and MongoDB, leveraging the native HTTP API to handle requests and responses without external frameworks.
Key Features:
* User Management: Users can register, log in, and upload assignments.
* Admin Functionality: Admins can view submitted assignments and either accept or reject them.
* Authentication: JWT is used for secure authentication and session management.
* Database Integration: MongoDB is utilized for storing user information, assignments, and other related data.
The project structure is modular, separating controllers, models and middlewares, ensuring clean and maintainable code. The native HTTP API allows lightweight handling of requests without the need for Express or other frameworks


Prerequisites
Node.js (version 16+)
MongoDB (version 5+)
Postman or similar (optional for API testing)


Install Dependencies
npm install
npm init -y
npm install mongodb bcryptjs jsonwebtoken


Configure MongoDB Connection
const uri = 'mongodb://localhost:27017';  // MongoDB connection string
const client = new MongoClient(uri);
const dbName = 'assignmentportal';  // Change the database name if necessary


You need to create a database in your MongoDB. The database will be located at the above mentioned localhost.


How to run:
node server.js

For the API, registration and login can be done directly via the respective endpoints. Upon successful login, a token is generated. If you log in with the "user" role, the system will generate a token that must be included in subsequent requests to protected routes.
For example, when accessing the /user/upload or /user/alladmins endpoints, the token must be added to the request headers. The header key should be "Authorization" and the value must be in the format "Bearer <token>".
Similarly, for admin specific routes such as /admin/assignments and /admin/assignments/:id/accept, the same token-based authentication process is followed. Ensure the token is passed in the header for these requests as well, using the same "Authorization" key and "Bearer <token>" format.
